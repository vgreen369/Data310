### Lab 3

# Question 1

An "ordinary least squares" (or OLS) model seeks to minimize the differences between your true and estimated dependent variable.

True. The model seeks to calculate the "least squares", or the smallest square area created between a true and an estimated variable. 
# Question 2
In a linear regression model, all feature must correlate with the noise in order to obtain a good fit.

Disagree. All features don't have to correlate with the noise in order to obtain a good fit. Rather, they shouldcorrelate with the dependent variable or other features.

# Question 4
In practice we determine the weights for linear regression with the "X_test" data.

False. The weigths are arbitrarily taken then reduced using the cost function until they create a line of best fit.
# Question 5
Polynomial regression is best suited for functional relationships that are non-linear in weights.


False, Polynomial regression is best suited for functional relationships that are non-linear in FEATURE VARIABLES(x^2)
# Question 6
Linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression can be all fit using LinearRegression() from the sklearn.linear_model module in Python.

True, ALthough the model wouldn't be as accurate in the case of polynomial functions.
# Question 7

# Question 8
The gradient descent method does not need any hyperparameters.


False, needs a 'b' and an 'm'

# Question 9 
![steps](9.PNG)
1. import matplotlib
2. create the subplots
3. add the data to the scatterplots
4. add grids and ticks to the plots
# Question 10
Which of the following forms is not  linear in the weights ?
